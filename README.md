A recreation of the Asteroids game, using the Phaser JavaScript framework.

If you wish to play locally:  
You can not drag-and-drop the index.html file, otherwise the sprites will not render properly.    
Use the Live Server plugin for Visual Studio Code. There may be other methods of bypassing the error that causes sprites to fail to render.  
I'm sure a more experienced programmer can circumvent the error.  
Sidenote: Obviously the game does not work on mobile devices.
